## Setting up a tribe node


### Linux

Under Linux run:
```sudo apt-get install wget jq
wget https://github.com/paw-digital/paw-scripts/raw/master/linux_paw_node_install.sh
bash linux_paw_node_install.sh
```

### Mac

Under Mac run:
```brew install wget jq
wget https://github.com/paw-digital/paw-scripts/raw/master/mac_paw_node_install.sh
sh mac_paw_node_install.sh
```

### Windows
```
Download the executable:
https://github.com/paw-digital/paw-scripts/releases/download/v1/installer.exe

Place it and run it where you want the node installed. It will create a folder with the latest node and set everything up.
```

### After running the install script

Your node should have gotten set up automatically after running the install script and output you a private key and address.

Save your private key and send a minimum of 0.01 PAW to the account to open it.

For the tribe to start voting all you need is to have other people delegate PAW to it.
